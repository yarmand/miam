## links
An image can be significant. Others can be "attached" to it. The system will generate a specific tag to represend the __master__ image and attached others to it.

## path
Tag can be assembled in hierarchy to represent a path on the same model than time tags.

example:
- `summer 2018` / `hikes` / `bear trail`

a single image can be part of several collection based on path. For example beside the previous example path, an image can also belong to:
- `summer 2018` / `dogs`

An image will be return with a seach on any of the tags from the path.
